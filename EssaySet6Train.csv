14858,6,In building Empire State Building builders faced problems allowing dirigibles dock Some obstacles builder faced actually way dirigibles dock feet ground The strong air currents changing wind direction also made difficult piolots steer dirigibles close enough mast docking A final problem builders faced law airships flying low urban areas NUM Which basically means docked Empire State building would low urban aera law,2,3,3,62,60,28,16,8,4,0.31
14859,6,The idea mooring dirigibles top building stood feet streets downtown New York facinating amazing idea An idea would bring New York whole age transportation NUM Unfortunately wonderful idea holes plans Later architects building mooring mast discovered idea going fulfill The idea many obstacles overcome The fact dirigibles outside U S used hydrogen rather helium hydrogen highly flammable NUM If anything go wrong would catostrophic seeing highly populated streets Also greatest obstacle nature NUM There much wind keep aircraft steady undercontrol The reality fact idea moor derigibles sounded great far many risks carry plan,2,4,2,93,70,42,19,13,9,0.37
14860,6,In excerpt The Mooring CAPS Marcia Amidon CAPS builders empire State Building faced obstacles attempting allow dirigibles dock The Empire State Building destined never fulfill purpose due many reasons many obstacles One many reason dirigibles outside United States used hydrogen rather helium hydrogen highly flammable Furthermore biggest obstacle sucessful use morning mast nature Due reason winds top building constantly shifting due violent air currents Even dirigible tethered mooring mast back ship would swivel around around mooring mast Using Empire State Building would dangling high pedestrians Street neither practical safe The obstacles existing law airships flying low urban areas This law would make illegal ship ever tie building even approach area although two dirigibles attempt reach building entire idea dropped The builders Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles,3,3,3,128,55,49,27,26,9,0.31
14861,6,The builders Empire State Building face many obstacles attempting allow dirigibles dock One obstacle faced safety issue As stated paragraph NUM foreign dirigibles used flammable element hydrogen rather helium A fire would deadly highly populated area like downtown New York Another obstacle builders faced wind In paragraph NUM says The winds top building constantly shifting due violent air currents This would cause un tied back dirigible thrash around even swivel around mooring mast When dirigible moored open fields weighted lead weights Doing open air Empire State building would un safe due pedestrians The final obstacle builders faced law airships flying low urban areas In paragraph NUM says This law would make illegal ship ever tie building even approach area This mooring mast dirigibles Empire State building never served purpose,3,3,3,129,70,48,27,24,10,0.33
14862,6,Based excerpt The Mooring Mast Marcia Amidon L sted many obstacles builders Empire State Building faced allowing diriibles land One obstacles safety problems The drigibles come close enough Empire State building could able tie dirible This put diribles close people There law stated airships fly low urban areas There disaster happened Lakehurst New Jersey trying prevent happening New York paragraph NUM Another problem builders faced strong winds nature allow diribles get close enough tie mast There many obstacles builders face end worth making Empire state building dirible dock,3,3,3,88,75,38,20,16,7,0.29
14863,6,The builders Empire State Building faced many obstacles attempting allow dirigibles dock The steel frame Building needed modified strengthened make place dirigibles dock Also sixty thousand dollars worth modifications made The last obstacle builders thousand foot dirigible moored top building would add stress buildings frame It easy builders build mooring mast top highest building one thousand two hundred fifty feet architects reached point designing mooring mast,2,3,3,66,65,24,20,12,1,0.19
14864,6,While building Empire State Building workers faced many obstactles attempting dirigibles dock A dirigible attached mast building would add extra stress builders instead sixty thousand dollars worth reconstructions fix buldings framework Dirigibles also dock line running front ship mast planned blimp able sway wind unrealistic ship could attach building high winds Other obstacles faced letting dirigibles dock building safety hazards hydrogen used dirigibles outside U S highly flammable Builders also take consideration pre existing law airships flying low urbanized areas illegal dirigible tie building The task dirigibles attach Empire State building impossible task begin,3,4,4,94,45,42,23,16,5,0.28
14865,6,There many reasons architects problems allowing dirigibles dock empire State building One problems dirigibles NUM ft long would much There Would single cable tether would add stress buildings frame The entire Steel frame would modified strengthened would cost sixty thousand dollars The greatest reason mooring mast would never fullfill purpose safety Most dirigibles United States used hydrogen rather helium hydrogen highly flammable The greatest obsticale successful use mooring nature The winds top buildings constantly shifting due violent air currents Even dirigible tethered mooring mast back Ship would swivel around They meant land open playing feilds using empire state building Where would dangling high pedestrians safe,3,3,3,105,65,37,19,21,10,0.26
